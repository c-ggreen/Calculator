# Calculator
A simple Calculator Application created with React using hooks. Please visit my [Heroku](https://calculator-app-cg.herokuapp.com/) to take a look.

### Issues
- ~~Unable to concatenate multiple numbers on one line. For example, "59", "100", "1250" will not render, only single digits.~~
- ~~Decimal button doesn't work/has no use due to not being able to concatenate.~~
- When two operands and an operant exist, if another operant is introduced the app doesn't automatically solve between the previous operands it instead replaces the most recent operand, meaning every equation is limited to two inputs after which the calculator must be made to compute the solution.
